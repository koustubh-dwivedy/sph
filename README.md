Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulation using OpenCL
Implementation of following paper -> http://www.glowinggoo.com/sph/bin/kelager.06.pdf /n
Part of ME 766 High Performance Scientific Computing course project /n
Code built and tested on Ubuntu 14.04 /n
As of now, code cannot handle number of particles greater than ~30,000. To handle them, variables will need to be converted from int to long int. /n
